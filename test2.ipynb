      " So how do I celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi, huh?  Well basically, the celebration itself starts at least 2 days prior to all the actual festivals.  So all of my family members come together, gather in a house, in an old and special house.  And then we do activities like clean the house, do the decoration, do the maturi and all that stuff.  And on Ganesh Chaturthi, we, you know, bring the deity's idols.  Like we do pujasana and arthis and etc. etc.  We have traditional food prepared for the deity.  Like nevidya, sweets such as mudak and all that.  We burst firecrackers.  And yeah, so it's usually one and a half day, five days, seven days.  And yeah, that's how we celebrate Ganesh Chaturthi.  So what is my favorite moment during Ganesh Chaturthi?  Yeah, definitely my family getting together and all that stuff.  You know, it's kind of good.  All of my family members working together to a certain goal, to a certain thing.  You know, then the third question, according to you,  one thing should change about Ganesh Chaturthi festivals.  Okay, so you know, these days it's nuclear families.  Two to three, we are already together for two to three days.  I think we should be together.  As a family, we should be together for more than that.  You know, we should meet often.  We should see often.  That's one thing about I like about Ganesh Chaturthi.  And I think, you know, it should be incorporated into everything.  You know, every other festival that we come across.  Thank you.\n"
